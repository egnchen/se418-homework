This is a java implementation of `Lab 2: Fun with Collections` of course `SE232` Program design and data structures.

Currently the repo only contains the implementation of `Problem I Word ladders`.

## Usage

### Installation
* clone the repo to your computer

```bash

```

### Running the program

Run the java program first:
* for IDEA users:
    * Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
    * Press `Run` or use shortcut `Shift+F10`
    * Choose `WordLadderSolver`
* for non-IDE users:

To generate a word ladder, follow the prompts generated by the program, here is an example, where **bold text** represents user inputs:

>
> Enter destination word: **that**
>
> Found path: this => thin => than => that
