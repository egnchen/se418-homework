# Lab02

This is a java implementation of `Lab 2: Fun with Collections` of course `SE232` Program design and data structures.

Currently the repo only contains the implementation of `Problem I Word ladders`.

## Usage

### Installation
* clone the repo to your computer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eyeKill/lab02-java-port.git
```

### Running the program

Run the java program first:
* for IDEA users:
    * Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
    * Press `Run` or use shortcut `Shift+F10`
    * Choose `WordLadderSolver`
* for non-IDE users:
    * Use `javac`

To generate a word ladder, follow the prompts generated by the program, here is an example, where **bold text** represents user inputs:
> Enter start word (RETURN to quit): **this**
>
> Enter destination word: **that**
>
> Found path: this => thin => than => that

### Use the RESTful web interface
The newest version has implemented a RESTful web interface for the word ladder, taking advantage of the powerful Spring framework.

To run the web service in IntelliJ IDEA, simply run `Lab02Application.java` in the IDE. The Spring framework will handle the trivial stuff for you.

After the web service has started, type in the browser:
```
http://localhost:8080/get-ladder?src=lover&dst=hater
```
To get the word ladder between `lover` and `hater` in `JSON` format.
```
{"state":"OK","src":"lover","dst":"hater","ladder":["lover","laver","later","hater"]}
```
The service would put different values in the `state` variable in case of internal errors and user input errors.

```
GET http://localhost:8000/get-ladder?src=lover&dst=hate

{"state":"input error","src":"lover","dst":"hate","ladder":null}
```
